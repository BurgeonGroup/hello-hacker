# hello-hacker

Hello Hacker is a web based program for playing with a 5x5 led grid using
JavaScript! It also includes an emulator so you can try it without the hardware.
Great for experimenters of all ages.

It is written using Node.js, and intended for use in modern browsers.
First install Node from nodejs.org, and then run these two commands
to install and start Hello Hacker:

`npm install -g hello-hacker`
`sudo hello-hacker`
